This week we did an introductory GitHub assignment that taught us how to properly integrate our own changes into a repository. We learned to work on a forked copy of the original project and then submit a pull request in order to merge that work into the master version. Once we submit a PR, other people can make comments on it and request changes on it before it finalizes. We also learned how to create issues in a repository to make people aware of any problems that might exist.

As for our group project, we worked on the basic features of our extension, which is a panic button for Facebook. The features we currently have implemented are to hide the news feed and to unfollow pages. I worked on the news feed feature, which comes in handy when a user needs to block access to the news feed in order to prevent themselves from procrastinating. The progress is going well with the extension.
