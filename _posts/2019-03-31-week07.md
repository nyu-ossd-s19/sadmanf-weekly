# My take on Wikipedia

## From your own point of view, what kind of people contribute to Wikipedia
In my point of view, Wikipedia contributors are extremely passionate about making knowledge accessible to anyone with an internet access. Being able to obtain information on almost anything in the world is extremely empowering and the main contributors probably want to further that cause. 

## Do you think you might one day become a regular contributor
I doubt that I will be a regular contributor of Wikipedia. But that is mostly due to the fact that the topics in which I can confidently speak about are probably covered very well in Wikipedia. While there are definitely other ways to contribute, such as fixing grammar or spelling, those contributions don't interest me as much.

## How will you select the articles to contribute as part of the required contributions for this class?
When I created my account on Wikipedia, they conveniently had recommendations for beginner-friendly contributions. These articles were mostly ones that needed desperate grammar fixes.

## Watch and comment on the TED talk that Jimmy Wales gave on the Birth of Wikipedia in 2005 (did you find any ideas and topics that were out of date?)
