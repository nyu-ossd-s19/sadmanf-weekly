title: Week 12
---

This past week, we had a group workshop day and a presentation from Kevin Fleming. I really enjoyed his presentation because he went into a lot of detail on the use of open source within Bloomberg and the greater tech community. He was very honest about the benefits and dangers of using open source and extremely informative. The most surprising thing I learned from his presentation was the fact that Google sponsors or hires engineers that solely work on open source projects that aren't actually being used by Google. I thought that was very admirable of the company to support the community to that extent. The most interesting part of the talk was the portion where he mentioned that immense network spike within 9 seconds. I'm very interested in distributed computing and large scale projects in general, so I really enjoyed hearing about that experience.

For the project we've been doing, I submitted a PR with my group members working on an issue that had been reported the week before. I also commented on the original issue and posted pictures of the change (courtesy of Rachel). The original issue creator liked the change and someone commented on the PR making suggestions.
