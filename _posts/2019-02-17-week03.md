This week, our group created our Facebook Panic button extension and presented the work to the class. We all worked on the project remotely because all the features were independent of each other. Because of this, it was also easy to make design decisions because we could make a master menu with different buttons for all the different functionality and branch out accordingly. I added in the news feed hiding feature, but realized I made a mistake in deleting the div instead of just hiding it.
