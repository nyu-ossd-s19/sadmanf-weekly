## Spring Framework

Spring uses the Apache License 2.0. It provides a patent license from the contributors of the code that allows anyone to use the code freely with no charge or royalties owed. You may add your own copyright statement but you cannot add any trademarks. You cannot hold anyone liable for damages as a result of the project. Any contributions to this project will automatically be upheld by the same license that govern the rest of the project.
