# HFOSS evaluation

Using open source software for humanitarian purposes is a very commendable endeavor. Open source principles are already very similar to those of humanitarian groups, in that they both promote transparency, empowerment, and work that serves to better the community as a whole. 

With all that being said, I feel like it is more difficult to get started in these projects than other general open source projects. For one, there is a more mission critical aspect for HFOSS projects because they have real impact on people's lives (Chamindra de Silva). These projects are also not created for other developers, so contributors need a good understanding of how to create software for untrained volunteers. It needs to be intuitive and easy to use. There is also a time sensitive nature for some of these projects (especially disaster relief ones) and therefore the community might not be able to compromise on time by helping newcomers learn the ropes. However, there are also HFOSS projects that aren't mission critical and are beginner friendly. In those cases, it is probably just as easy to get involved as it is for any other project.

As a result of all the high quality work that needs to be done for these projects in such a short amount of time, and the fact that these contirbutors are helping save lives, there is probably more "prestige" attached to working in HFOSS projects. However, I doubt that most people contributing to these projects are doing so in order to gain "prestige", and mostly care about helping others.
